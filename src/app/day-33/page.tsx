                  life in 2040 compare what everyone told us till now
                </p>

                <p>
                  Remember when they said we would have flying cars by 2020..
                </p>

                <p>
                  Well that never happened but with the advancement in AI I think what will happen by 2040.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Will there be a cure for cancers?
                </p>

                <p>
                  Will we be on mars?
                </p>

                <p>
                  What exactly can we get from all the advancement in AI by 2040.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here's my guess.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Apps will be written in 1 prompt. Fully functional and it will just be a marketing game.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Marketing will turn to more personal channels like newsletters because people won't know what is real or fake on socials.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Yea you'll have your regular influencers , YouTubers celebrities but it will be different. An AI model can be an influencer now just imagine in X amount of years. Then it's under a brand. Since you have someone who runs them.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Companies will look for people or businessss to do this and it won't stop there.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Imagine you spin up a content creator all AI generated pusbing a narritive.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I would of been writing for over 5,000 days and I think my brand will be better than others. Why? Because email is personable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Brands will look more for users who have been around and see established rather than not.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So what do you need to do.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Learn to storytell build a community of our peers and you'll succeed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We can build apps in a day but if you can't market. Whats the point?
