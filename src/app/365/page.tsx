                The crazy thing about doing this solo is my focus is 100%. I don't have an distractions when writing this. I can it down and budget 1 hour of my day writing this newsletter. No AI. Just me thinking and jotting down what I learned, thought about etc.

                The point is. I am still doing it. 90% of people won't send their first 3 issues of a newsletter(they quit before they send them). That is mostly everything I have seen.

                <li>Try to have 8-10 posts on Linked In, X , Threads</li>
                <li>Eventually build out the blogs SEO and do heavy pSEO work.</li>

                Reddit was a gold mine to simply plug my newsletter all over and wait for people to join. I even had a few viral post that made me hit 4k subs within about 2 months.

                The hardest part isn't the sale.... It's finding the right customers. Yesterday, Justin Welsh published his weekly newsletter, which is a big inspiration to me. He has figured out this solo business model and he really understands how to market.

                "But now I follow the 5-12-3 rule, which makes my life a heck of a lot easier. Every piece of content must work in 5 seconds (the hook grabs attention), remain relevant 12 months later (try your best for evergreen value), and function across at least three platforms (repurposing)."

                It's been a crazy 2 years since i joined the X community of indie hackers.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-blue-50 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I've built lots of stuff and had plenty of failures. But i've had quite a few successes.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-blue-50 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Niche Tools, Build The Idea, Under2k, to name a few. All of which did well for me.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-blue-50 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The best one ? Niche Tools. Did over 50k in total sales. I also sold it and bought it back( a story for another day).
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-blue-50 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Why am I saying all this? Simple. This newsletter's goal is to generate 50k in revenue in one year. We are only on day 2. So we got a long way to go.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-blue-50 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I also don't want to sell sponsorships and want to keep this personal. We will see how i sprinkle in some of these ideas.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-blue-50 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I wanna work on my storytelling. It's an art form that i'd love to master. Keeping you reading to the very last line. I know how quickly I move on the next thing.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-blue-50 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                So what is the goal of this newsletter? It's simple. Improve everyday & build it into a 1 million dollar business. How? Not sure but i'm ready to try.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-blue-50 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                So we keep writing and we will see what it brings me.

                I promise this is the last time i'm swapping topics! Look if you have followed me you know i go from one thing to another. The crazy thing is I always wanted to stick to one thing and one thing only for a year.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-blue-50 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I've had plenty of people tell me I need to and show people about different ways i talk and write and just really be myself. Talk about what i want on X, post what i want on here and just not worry about the money and fame.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-blue-50 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                So here's the deal. Today is Issue #1. I am going to write for the next 365 days about anything I want. I'll focus on what i'm interested on like finance news, crypto, ideas, side hustles etc but sometimes I may talk about how my kids were horrible and what i looked up as a dad. The point is, i'm just gonna write everyday and see what happens. I'll also post it to medium and see the type of following I grow just talking about my thoughts.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-blue-50 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I hope you follow me on the journey. See you tomorrow with topic #1
