                  I only use 3 things to keep my content wheel going.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Email octopus - Where i send my emails from<br/>
                  ChatGPT - Where I fix grammar errors etc<br/>
                  Typefully - Help me post to X, Linked In, Threads All at once.
                </p>

                <p>
                  That's it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Why so little? All of my content comes from my mind and i really dont want to be using AI to do much. Typefully is an easy one because it saves me hours a week and it's not "cheating" they just help me post my one thing to multiple channels a day.
                </p>

                <p>
                  And since i'm doing the 1 Newsletter to 10 platforms a day it makes sense to do it this way.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So how much do I pay?
                </p>

                <p>
                  Email Octopus is free but I am on the paid verision so i can have longer automations(even though I don't need it) so i'm paying $9. But it's free up to 500 contacts.
                </p>

                <p>
                  ChatGPT is free because the information I need isn't anywhere else but my mind so I just use it to clean up my content and change around simple wording for each platform im posting to.
                </p>

                <p>
                  FInally Typefully. They are a well known brand that makes it easy to post to X, Linked and Threads along with a few other but i'm focused on those for now.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Pricing = Typefully is $149/year<br/>
                  Email Octopus = $9/month
                </p>

                <p>
                  Typefully is around $12.50/month and Email Octopus is $9/month or 71 cents a day.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I do also pay the $8 plan for X because it's my main marketing channel.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So:
                </p>

                <p>
                  $12.50 + $9 + $8 = $29.5/month
                </p>

                <p>
                  The only price that will go up is the Email Octopus but as it goes up it will mean i get more subscribers so it will allow me to do well.
                </p>

                <p>
                  $30/month isn't bad when you look at it that way.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now what else could i buy?<br/>
                  Great questions there are tons of tools i would use to speed up my process but i'm on a tight budget and need to make money not spend more. So for now this will work.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Well it's safe to say I'm on a tight budget if you know my history you know I've basically been scraping these past 6 months and have accrued a<br/>
                  AI will help you in anyway you wish and with all the different free plans out there it only makes sense to stick with it.
