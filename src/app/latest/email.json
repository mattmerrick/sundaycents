    "content": "<p>I’m not here to say I’m able to keep people interested in the sense that I’ve been doing it well. But I’ve picked up a. Few things writing these for the past 30 days.</p><p><strong>1- You need a catchy subject line.</strong></p><p>I know this is so boring and like a duh moment. Like come on Matt tell me something else but really this is 90% of the battle. Get users to open it.</p><p>How do I do it?</p><p>Well, I write the full issue first, and then I figure out what then I decide on the subject line. You can use AI but I feel that is noticeable.</p><p>So I kinda pick 1-3 words that describe or hint at the entire issue and make it that. Short keep the user thinking. And making them want to click it. The better the subject line the better open rates I’ve seen.</p><p>Now that you got the user to open it.</p><p><strong>You gotta keep them to stay.</strong></p><p>2 - the thing with keeping someone reading your newsletter is you wanna make it so they read end to end right? But it’s proven that most won’t. So you gotta really sell them in the start to keep readings kinda like YouTubers do. If you watch till the end X will happen. For you if you read till the end X will happen</p><p>This can only get you so far. Not everyone cares or they get bored. It’s why it’s good to story tell your way through it all. So make sure you give them a reason to keep reading.</p><p>Keep the paragraphs short… don’t make it long. Short and condense it. You write a paragraph of content. Try and rewrite it in sentence. People wanna consume information quickly. Most are use to social media and scrolling which is what 60 seconds? TikTok. Think that way. Plus you are writing so it’s even less. Don’t add fluff in today’s day in age people just want quick facts. There is. Reason tldr tech does so well.</p><p>He cracked the formula.. 3 sections 2 items in each 1 paragraph overview of the article with the link. It’s why he’s racked up over a million subscribers. Find a niche -> chop it down - but your personality on it.</p><p>People didn’t read tldr for the articles they share(most prolly see them anyway). They read it because how he summarized the articles was different/original. be different and you will be fine.</p>"

Will we be on mars? What exactly can we get from all the advancement in AI by 2040.</p><p>Here’s my guess. Apps will be written in 1 prompt. Fully functional and it will just be a marketing game. Marketing will turn to more personal channels like newsletters because people won’t know what is real or fake on socials.</p><p>Yea you’ll have your regular influencers , YouTubers celebrities but it will be different. An AI model can be an influencer now just imagine in X amount of years. Then it’s under a brand.

Why so little? All of my content comes from my mind and I really don't want to be using AI to do much. Typefully is an easy one because it saves me hours a week and it’s not “cheating” they just help me post my one thing to multiple channels a day. And since I’m doing the 1 Newsletter to 10 platforms a day it makes sense to do it this way.</p><p>So how much do I pay?</p><p>Email Octopus is free but I am on the paid version so I can have longer automations (even though I don’t need it) so I’m paying $9. But it’s free up to 500 contacts. ChatGPT is free because the information I need isn’t anywhere else but my mind so I just use it to clean up my content and change around simple wording for each platform I'm posting to.</p><p>Finally Typefully. They are a well known brand that makes it easy to post to X, Linked and Threads along with a few other but I’m focused on those for now. Pricing = Typefully is $149/year. Email Octopus = $9/month. Typefully is around $12.50/month and Email Octopus is $9/month or 71 cents a day. I do also pay the $8 plan for X because it’s my main marketing channel.</p><p>So: **$12.50 + $9 + $8 = $29.5/month**</p><p>The only price that will go up is the Email Octopus but as it goes up it will mean I get more subscribers so it will allow me to do well. $30/month isn’t bad when you look at it that way. Now what else could I buy? Great questions there are tons of tools I would use to speed up my process but I’m on a tight budget and need to make money not spend more. So for now this will work. Well it’s safe to say I’m on a tight budget if you know my history you know I’ve basically been scraping these past 6 months and have accrued a AI will help you in anyway you wish and with all the different free plans out there it only makes sense to stick with it.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Automation is key to anything. The problem is you have to figure out how to use it properly. Don’t just type into ChatGPT or other platforms do this for me you need systems, guidance etc.</p><p>What do I mean? I recently figured out this newsletter needs to be shared across all channels. I currently post to X, Linked In, Threads , and Medium. But with automation I can post to more: TikTok , Facebook, Instagram , YouTube, Pinterest. That gives me 5 more places to go viral get more users. That I’ve never posted any of my content to.</p><p>So how can I do that? Well there are tools like post bridge that can help you but you need to make the content. So how can you make it? There are plenty of ways to make it. For me since it’s my own newsletter and I’m using the name I’m gonna just use simple photos and share ideas. Like a slideshow etc. This way it be a video that you can share across all those last 4. So..</p><p>5 Text focused channels: X, Linked In, Facebook, Threads , Medium, Pinterest (with images )<br/>3 video focused channels: YouTube , Instagram , TikTok</p><p>1 “post” automatically sent to all different channels. Daily… for the next 30 days and I bet I’ll see results. We will revisit this and see how good I can do with that!</p><p>For you … think of a way to get going on marketing. But remember don’t go crazy. What do I mean? pick 1-2 channels to heavily focus on while the others are just repurposing the content with AI prompts to format them for those channels. So you write thread for X. Take that and turn it into a short video with AI, slideshow, etc for video and convert the thread into the correct formats for other channels.</p><p>All that matters is you start doing it.. do it for 30 days and I promise you you’ll see results.</p>"

    "title": "30 Days In: What I've Learned (Doubt, Money, and Dreams)",
    "content": "<p>30 days of writing this newsletter every single day. That's kinda crazy because I haven't focused on something this long and stayed with it in a long time. Prolly since the days I was playing basketball.</p><p>Here's what I learned:</p><ul><li>Major Doubt</li><li>Wanna Quit</li><li>Look at the subscriber count</li><li>Marketing</li></ul><p>So let's just start it right off with... I beat myself up on anything. I know things take time, but man, I am not good at it.</p><p>I have been product/ idea hopping since I was born, I feel like. The only thing that ever mattered to me was basketball. So it's nice to get into a groove, and writing every single day is surely awesome. But I didn't believe in myself this entire time. I even changed the type of newsletter this would be a few times. I went from it being about soloprenurship, to personal, to side hustles. So I switched, but I kept writing every day. Now I have a simple way to explain it. \" A Daily newsletter that makes you think\"</p><p>Why this? Well, I wanna write about whatever I want but also make it push you. You are the reason I get to write every day... So I wanna make it benefit you.</p><p>I've wanted to quit a few times on this and start something else because let's face it. During these 30 days... No money has come in from this newsletter. Which isn't a problem. But when you come from running micro saas's that get sales within their first 24 hours, not having anything for 30 days is a lot.</p><p>But the bright side is I haven't really \"sold\" anything. I am working on a short boo,k I guess, but not sure what I wanna do with it.</p><p>I have most likely looked at the subscriber count more than anything I've ever done. In the grocery store.. refresh list. Going to bed, refresh the list. waiting to pick up the kids from school, refresh the list. The number of times I've done it is kinda obsessive.</p><p>Marketing hasn't been good because I've switched so much in my marketing efforts. One thing I have done is write pretty much every day for Medium. You can follow my Medium account</p><p>Now that I talk about \"everything,\" I can make my marketing different and better? Not really sure, but the idea is to make it work. I will keep on talking and you can help me by keep on sending my issues to people.</p><p>Remember <strong>Never give up on your dreams.</strong> I have $-49 in my bank account while writiting this waiting for my new job to start. But I'm gonna stick with writing because I love it even if I never make a dollar from it.</p><p>Do something you love and you'll never feel like you worked a day in your life. That saying is true but they forget one thing you eventually need to make money. But most things people wanna do that they can DO they will make money if you stay consientent.</p><p>What do I mean by this?</p><p>I wanted to be a professional basketball player. Play for the NY knicks. That was my dream. But reality was I wasn't good enough. Yeah I played in college, but the Pros is a different league. It's another animal that I wasn't good enough for. So that was my dream. But my other dream has always been to write. What? I don't know a book maybe but as I said before, I love just writing and seeing what comes out. This is all top of my mind no edits, no reviews. That's how I write....</p><p>So this is a dream that can't happen right. You can do what you love but I can't go play basketball. Maybe over in europe but I'm to old. The point is if it's attainable like you wanna build a SaaS then sure you can do it. Nothing is holding you back now.</p><p>That's the cool thing about life right now. We are in the Dot com bubble (I was to young) where millionaires were made overnight. <strong>Don't miss this opportunity.</strong></p><p>Do 1 boring thing every single day and you'd be suprised what you can do. Writing not your thing? Make templates, sell them on Etsy. The possibilities are endless. Don't waste your time.</p><p>Build that thing that you love to do, and like me, after 30 days, see what happened. You'd be surprised. I may not of made any money, but I got almost 100 subscribers who read every issue + some of you have been so kind in your responses. I reply to all, so feel free to reach out on anything or tell me something cool you are working on!</p><p>30 days , 30 newsletter issues. Thank you for reading. I'm not stoping so here is to another 3000!</p>"

I have been writing this newsletter daily for the past 21 days, and I've seen a few things + know a few things from previous products. I know my time will get even less when I start my new job next week.</p><p>So, how do you attract new users while you sleep? <strong>Automations..... and X Articles.</strong></p><p>Now... hear me out. I recently published an article on X and it has done decent. You can read it here (make sure to like, comment etc it helps me out). The article was simple and it was my firt test at using it.</p><p>My plan is simple. Write 1 post a day use it all on all socials in different formats....</p><p>How? It's simple.</p><ul><li>I write my post/topic in a google doc. No edits, no AI, just me and my thoughts and the article/post I'm trying to publish.</li><li>Once I finish, I'm ready for the next step. Cleaning it up.</li><li>I run it through ChatGPT to fix grammar errors and punctuation errors. Then I re copy it to my google doc as a new verision.</li><li>I have Grammarly Pro, so I take this time to check if ChatGPT made any errors and read over the blog post one more time before publishing it to X, LinkedIn, Medium, Threads, Reddit (if it makes sense) my blog, and now X articles.</li></ul><p>1 piece of writing, spread out to 6 different places. That's 6 times it can go viral all from 20-30 minutes of work. This is why **AI is your friend as a solopreneur**. I just completed my entire day of marketing in under half an hour. Allowing you to get back to what matters... building your business.</p><p>For example; I use SuperX to schedule some of my content. This allows me to focus on finding more content or simply just finishing a few things in the house. You can use chatgpt or any of the writing tools as well but none of them are as good as the Super X + chatgpt does a decent job for you.</p><p>P.S. - I am putting together a free 5-day email course on soloprenurship, so look out for the invite to that.</p>"

X what do they all have in common?</p><p>They all are big companies that make millions if not billions a year. So what should you do? Build something around them.</p><p>Why? There is a market for them. They already have the users. Just find a product that you can make from it.</p><p>Here is a prompt that you can use for any big company:</p><blockquote>\"Generate 10 startup or micro-SaaS ideas inspired by [COMPANY NAME]. Each idea should reflect the company’s core value or system (e.g., community, attention, engagement, discovery). For each idea, include: 1. Concept name 2. What it does 3. How it mirrors [COMPANY NAME]’s core mechanic 4. Who would use it 5. How it could make money Keep the ideas realistic for a solo builder or small team.\"</blockquote><p>You will be suprised at how many options you get. Here' an example: This is a simple yet good idea. Now are there plenty of these around? Sure. But no one is doing it in the right way to capture millions of users. If you stick with it.... you can do well I'm sure of it.</p><p>Even if you don't know how to code you can learn + get templates from one of the best indie hackers around Marc Lou and use take is codefast course. I earned over 50k from his boilerplate alone. **start building.** You'd be suprised what happens in 6 months.</p><p>P.S. - I'm on day 20 of writing this daily newsletter. The goal is to grow this to a million dollar business by sharing what works and ways to make money on the internet each day. But I don't have 1 set audience which I know is never good.

AI can help you in the research department but you really need to put your own spin on stuff to get anything that will attract users, rank on google and do well for your blog, post or whatever you are working on.</p><p>How do I know this? I was a blogger back in the day...nothing special I did it in crazy simple niches that no one knew about but it's where I made my first internet money.</p><p>The blog was simple.... it was right when twitch and other sites were taking off and this concept of \"streaming\" video games was a thing.</p><p>The blog? Help you become a better stream... my best article was Best Streaming PC's and I'd link to top Products on amazon. I was getting 4% and killing it with 100's of users coming to my site daily. With some of these products selling for $1,000+ I was making decent money.</p><p>Then it all came down.. I stopped caring about the blog (typical me) and start focusing on another blog, the content got old and big players like forbes, toms hardware and others starting seeing the trend. They built out fully detailed articles with actual reviews (they bought the products as well). That was my first taste of ranking on google. <strong>I was hooked.</strong></p><p>Now while writing is easier because the ideas come faster, the highlights / overviews are easier to get. You still need to story tell and keep the reader in but also allow them to skim if they want. I don't have stats on it but my guess is 90% read the article till they see a highlight or \"top\" items. That's why lists up top or table of contents have become so popular.</p><p>Now every AI wrapper is trying to help you write blog posts. The artform is dying to just AI generate slop.</p><p>I still think if you do 90% AI and even as little as 10% human. You will rank on top of google.</p><p>So what should you do? **Start blogging.** If you don't wanna own it medium is a good platform and I've commited to writing daily on there and share results.</p>"

It helps you in so many ways:</p><ul><li>Mental Health</li><li>Memory</li><li>Happyness</li></ul><p>Plus if you keep at it with where AI is going it's going to be more important than ever to have a \"voice\" and letting people understand you wrote something insead of AI.

If you are posting on Linked In you may not get the same engagment as you would on Tiktok. One of my favorite newsletter is TLDR. He is always looking for sponsorships and charges a hefty penny for them and he runs those ads on Linked In.... because that's where his audience is for that specific item. When he was looking for subscribers, he mentioned in a podcast that he used quora to get his initial subscribers.</p><p>for me my plan is simple. GO viral on X and other writing platofrms and keep on building out this newsletter to help you become a better writer. Because as I've mentioned AI is taking over and <strong>storytelling will become an even bigger skill</strong> that I am betting all my eggs on. None of my content is AI generated this is straight from my mind to these emails. I don't prep, I just write and then hope it makes sense. So how can you go viral?</p><p>Focus on one platform. If you are doing like me am doing... writing. X is a good start and with tools like typefully (affiliate link) you can cross-promote seamly so you are getting users on other social medias.

So we will continue on this route. In the next few weeks I'll be posting detailed threads to socials to see if that can drive traffic.</p><p>New here? make sure to subscribe</p>"

    "content": "<p>Small is better.</p><p>Why?</p><p>No one can just jump right into this world and think that having millions of followers happens. No... it not like that. It takes time and effort.. That's why many fail.</p><p>You see that small is better because once you have that core group of friends, followers, or subscribers. The rest kinda falls into place. Your followers will grow slowly as long as the initial ones you start with are active. Do you know who's always in your comment section etc? I do. These are the people you ping or write to on the side to get feedback. Your first users, your base community... **They are the core of your business. Treat them like royalty.**</p><p>There is a reason you don't hear of many cases where someone blows up in a month.... most people grind for months, years before they get their big break.</p><p>The good thing is with small audiences is you are able to keep those people close to you and just like this newsletter you feel closer with them. I'm only writing to 53 of you right now. One day I may be writing to 50,000 but I'll never forget you.</p><p>Keep going and making an effort to become the best you can be. Remember everyone has a talent... you just gotta find it. Build small and watch it compound like crazy.</p><p>P.S. - I am writing once a day on medium if you are on there, I'd love for you to read some of my work.</p>"

    "content": "<p>How to make money on the internet is changing year by year.</p><p>But if you wanna build it correctly here are the best ways to do it.</p><ul><li>**Sell your own product** - This one is obvious but lots of people don't understand how important this is. If you can build an audience then sell something to them you have a good chance of making good money. Become the expert.</li><li>**Affiliate Links** - If you are like me you have always built blogs around affiliate links. Back in the day I even was building web hosting blogs to promote high paying web host companies. This is no different now but no longer do you need to write it in a blog or post. You can simply post to Youtube/Tiktok and add your affilaite link.</li><li>**Sponsorships** - Build an audience like I metnioned before and then sell spots in where your audience is. This one is tricky because unless you have an email like I am doing, adding content on your social media to much with ads is a lot.</li></ul><p>There are plenty more ways to do this but imo these are the best ways to grow now. With AI taking over you need to build something that people want, grow an audience in a niche you love or else you will fall behind. I was able to build 10+ apps make 50K from them and sell them all off. All from AI and this course. Kinda crazy that you can build profitable side hustles in days.</p><p>What was the best way to make money you have seen? Do you agree with the 3 areas I've picked. Would love your feedback.</p>"

    "title": "\"Sell Me This Pen\": 5 Ways to Close the Sale",
    "content": "<p>Because it's not easy. \"Sell me this Pen\" (name that movie)</p><p>The thing is everyone can sell... but can you close. Everyone can give the details of their products, their newsletter, the thing they are building.</p><p>But.... **can you make some pay.**</p><p>That's the hard part but you can make it easier if you do a few things:</p><ul><li>**Market to the right audience.** A fisherman looking for new lures won't be interested in a new running shoe. Find where your audience hangs out and live there.</li><li>**Make the product sell itself.** Don't overcomplicate anything. Your thesis should make it dead simple for people to get why they should buy. 99% of the time people buy on impulse.</li><li>**Give yourself 3-6 months.** As someone who product jumped a lot and looking back on it now that I'm writing this newsletter everyday. I wish I focused on things for longer. Built a legit product then worried about expanding it.</li><li>**Talk to your customers.** If you have 1 person or 100 make sure you ask them for feedback. Just like this newsletter. I'd love you to reply to this email (I answer all emails) and tell me what you like, what you don't like. Where you think I should go etc.</li><li>**Don't get hurt if they say no.** Rejection happens you can google all those stats that say 1 in 100 or 3% of people don't buy on the first time etc. You have to sell someone 7 times before they will buy. They will buy it or subscribe if you do it right and are in their circle.</li></ul><p>So what should you be doing. You should be posting more on socials... adding more pSEO content to your site. Use free tools to build your brand aweareness. That's what I did with niche tools.</p><p>P.S. - Have you shared this newsletter with anyone? I'm gonna build a referral system with a leaderboard eventually, I think. To make it like a game. Thoughts?</p>"

    "content": "<p>It's hard to be motivated when you aren't getting sales, subscribers, followers. The thing is.. That's where most people fail. They stop. They move on try something new. That is why there is so many less people who make it.</p><p>Side Hustles are hard... But I've had success in the over the years. But it didn't happen over night and it didn't last for long.</p><p>You see I got in on merch by amazon way before anyone else did and I had killer designs. Not because I was an artist or someone with a talent but more becaue I knew the sayings people would love.</p><p>One of my most popular ones? Dunkie Junkie.... A play on the popular coffee chain Dunkin.</p><p>The thing was. I had 1,000's of designs and It didn't really take off for about a year but then it went crazy. I even posted about it on reddit and it became one of my highest posts.</p><p>but with everything I do... I stopped focusing on it because I wasn't enjoying it I wasn't getting the sales, subscribers I wanted (1-2 sales a day) so I moved on.</p><p>Then Christmas came and my earnings went insane. 2k , 4k , 10k (December) and I started posting new designs, but I think it was to late. My products did well but then 100's of copycats came in lowered their prices and my margins were at $0.</p><p>I moved on and the 2-3k a month I was making slowly went down till this past year where we hit $10-$15 a month.</p><p>Ok Matt so what is the point? **The point is... don't give up, don't ever give up.** Just because your idea doesn't \"hit\" you can always find another one or similar one. The point is to keep going.</p><p>Similar to how I'm publishing this newsletter to new heights everyday. You need to find something and stick to it remember it takes 66 days to build a habit. Start building one day.</p><p>P.S. - Not sure how I'm gonna do sponsors etc (way to early) but would love your feedback on how you would like to see this newsletter strutured going forward (paid days) or advertiers paying $20/day for it to be displayed in the bottom here where P.S. is.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Ok so... I know the title says how to get subscribers and you are most likely saying. Matt... you only have 42 subscribers to this newsletter... how do you know about subscribers?</p><p>Well first off... thank you for being early and being one of the first 42 subscribers... it means the world. Second off... ya caught me. I may not know exactly how to do it yet. But little known fact is I already built 3 newsletter and sold them before this one. But I ain't selling this one ever. You are to special to sell to the top dollar even if they offer me $10 for you. I ain't ever selling. So I'm not a noob to the newsletter game and my previous newsletter I grew all from reddit. You can learn more about that with this free guide on how to grow on reddit.</p><ul><li>A clean + easy to understand message converts</li><li>Don't overpromise but overdeliver.</li><li>Talk, don't sell</li></ul><p>The first one is something lots of people don't think about... if you don't understand what you as a reader are signing up for. Would you really sign up? Most likely not. Ensure you have a clear understanding of what your newsletter is about.</p><p>Don't over promise.... seems simple but too many people love to lie. \"This newsletter is read by 100k people and has an open rate of 45%!\" When in reality you have less than 1k and an open rate less than 30%. People are more willing to subscribe/take a chance on your stuff if they know you are being honest. **Be honest, let them see what your going through. You will get more conversions and true fans that way.**</p><p>Finally the biggest one of all. Even though I have 42 subscribers. I haven't gone down since I started.... Why? I am not selling anything. In reality I'm doing the opposite... I'm learning and sharing what I learn for free. If someone reads all of my issues till I make my 1 million dollar mark. I feel like they will be able to do anything. Learning is half the battle and I love to learn new things to get ahead of the crowd. Now you get access to that as well. But don't tell anyone... we can keep that between us. This daily newsletter is gonna be an advanced course that people would pay thousands for all for free (maybe not... but my goal is let you live throug my struggles and successes so you can copy pasta them.

    "title": "My Million Dollar Plan: The Personal Brand Approach",
    "content": "<p>There is no one doing email marketing like I will do email marketing. Are there newsletters with millions of subcribers? Of course there are... but no one is doing a **\"personal brand\"** and trying to grow to 1 million subscribers in public.</p><p>So this is my plan. Build in Public but for new subscribers. My biggest problem right now isn't how to do it. It's what to focus on. Because let's be real. To Keep users interested most of the time you have to have something you always talk about or help them with. The obvious choice is being that newsletter person everyone talks about but sometimes that only get's so far. I need to think like James Clear. His newsletter is read by millions and it's a simple email. IT makes you think. Plus he has been doing it for a long time. So it makes sense.</p><p>See here is the thing... AI is gonna take over so much... that really all you have left is **being yourself.** So.... I'm building up my personal brand to make you fall in love with my writing. Sure I'll advertise here and there but most of the time we will just be talking.</p><p>That's step 1 of my master plan. Writing every single day \"should\" get me more people to read my stuff... one would hope. Then I take these newsletter issues and turn them into \"learning\" medium articles + reformat them for blog posts. This should help me with SEO and market shares I'm not 100% focused on but can bring in some good traffic in a year or two. Then the big one and my main focus for now - High quality threads or posts on Linked In, X, Threads. My only problem right now with them is... I don't know what to focus on... So I am testing the markets with different posts like this one or even this one. We can see what people love. so we keep building our audience. My theory is as I grow my following my subscribers will grow in this newsletter... but if you have ever done email marketing... you know the hardest part is getting someone to sign up to your email.</p><p>so let's keep moving. If you love this newsletter. make sure to forward this email to a friend!</p>"

    "content": "<p>Find your customers At the end of the day everything is a sell. You are selling something. It can range from liking an Instagram photo of your family to selling a digital product to your email list. You are always doing something that involves a sale.</p><p>The hardest part isn't the sale.... It's finding the right customers. Yesterday, Justin Welsh published his weekly newsletter, which is a big inspiration to me. He has figured out this solo business model and he really understands how to market. You can read his entire issue here: Leverage is the solopreneur cheat code</p><p>In a nutshell he broke down exactly how you need to build an audience and I'm gonna steal some of his tactics to grow my followings over the next few months. He said this:</p><blockquote>\"But now I follow the 5-12-3 rule, which makes my life a heck of a lot easier. Every piece of content must work in 5 seconds (the hook grabs attention), remain relevant 12 months later (try your best for evergreen value), and function across at least three platforms (repurposing).\"</blockquote><p>So it got me thinking. I need to focus on this in my space and start producing high quality content I can share across all socials. **SO it's time to lock in** and grow my customer base (subscribers) to a level that most haven't seen. I have 3 new subscribers from yestreday and my content is starting to be seen by a bigger audience. I plan to keep growing this newsletter and as mentioned before this is my only focus.</p><p>Have a good Sunday & talk tomorrow.</p>"
