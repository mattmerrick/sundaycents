It's $10/issue and you can book 1 month in advanced (since I'm writing everyday). I also will give discounts for multiple ad spots. Nothing fancy it will be in this section as a P.S - > Like you always see me do. But since you will be one of the first sponsors I'll share it to my 6k followers on X as well and my medium article. So really the first few people will get tons of exposure. I need $200 to pay a bill. So once I hit that amount, I will close ad spots down again.</p><p>Ok bye.</p>"

    "content": "<p>The funny thing is, they go so fast, but you don’t move at all.</p><p>I have lots of time to think on my commute daily, and I’m pretty much writing for the entire time.</p><p>Why? Because why not? I wanna be the person everyone follows for my writing. They open my emails to laugh, learn something, and think.</p><p>Thinking is so important. As you get older, the more you think and interact with people, the better. I don’t wanna stop writing, and trains showed me that.</p><p>The crazy thing is, you can too. There is time in your day when you can write, build whatever you wish.</p><p>But to me writing is the easiest. Put your thoughts on your phone, a notebook, and share them with people. You’d be surprised how many wanna read it.</p><p>If you watch TikTok for 30 minutes a night… instead write for 15, watch for 15. Over time, I bet you the writing will be longer than the watching.</p><p>Writing not your thing?</p><p>You can read, talk with friends, whatever you want. The people who get ahead aren’t wasting time with the fun stuff; they are doing the boring stuff.</p><p>So the train goes fast, but so can you. Make your time valuable, box out time to think and improve. Do that every day and you’ll be surprised.</p>"

    "title": "2 Keys to Keeping Newsletter Subscribers (The TLDR Formula)",
    "content": "<p>I’m not claiming to be a retention genius, but after thirty-plus issues I’ve learned a few things about keeping subscribers reading.</p><p><strong>1. Nail the subject line.</strong></p><p>Yes, it sounds obvious. It’s still 90% of the game. Write the email first, then pick a line that teases the core promise in two or three words. Curiosity beats clever every time.</p><p><strong>2. Earn every scroll.</strong></p><p>Most people won’t read to the end, so front-load the value. Hook them in the first paragraph the way YouTubers hook viewers—tell them what they’ll get if they keep going.</p><p>Make the writing easy to skim. Short paragraphs. Clear transitions. No fluff. Social feeds trained everyone to process information in seconds, so respect the pace.</p><p>That’s why TLDR thrives. Three sections, two items in each, one punchy summary per link. Simple, predictable, useful.</p><p>People don’t read TLDR because they’ve never seen the news—it’s because the summaries hit faster than the original articles. That’s the bar. Be different, be concise, and give them a reason to stay subscribed.</p>"

But with the pace of AI right now, 2040 will still be wild.</p><p>Will we cure cancer? Live on Mars? Maybe. What I know is software will change faster than ever.</p><p>Here’s my guess. Apps will be generated from a single prompt, fully functional in minutes. The hard part won’t be building—it’ll be marketing. Audiences won’t trust social feeds packed with AI-generated noise, so they’ll lean on personal channels like newsletters where real people show up daily.</p><p>Influencers won’t all be human. AI avatars will run accounts, push narratives, and sell products for brands that keep the scripts tight.</p><p>Companies will look for creators and teams who can steer these tools with a steady voice. Imagine launching a fully automated content creator that still feels human because you programmed the salt, not the sugar.</p><p>If I stay consistent, by 2040 I’ll have written more than 5,000 issues. That track record will make my brand more trustworthy than any synthetic feed. That’s the moat: showing up in people’s inboxes as an actual person.</p><p>So what do you do right now? Learn to tell stories. Build a community of peers. Ship apps fast if you want, but focus on the message. Without marketing, the code means nothing.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Automation is key to anything. The problem is you have to figure out how to use it properly. Don’t just type into ChatGPT or other platforms do this for me you need systems, guidance etc.</p><p>What do I mean? I recently figured out this newsletter needs to be shared across all channels. I currently post to X, Linked In, Threads , and Medium. But with automation I can post to more: TikTok , Facebook, Instagram , YouTube, Pinterest. That gives me 5 more places to go viral get more users. That I’ve never posted any of my content to.</p><p>So how can I do that? Well there are tools like post bridge that can help you but you need to make the content. So how can you make it? There are plenty of ways to make it. For me since it’s my own newsletter and I’m using the name I’m gonna just use simple photos and share ideas. Like a slideshow etc. This way it be a video that you can share across all those last 4. So..</p><p>5 Text focused channels: X, Linked In, Facebook, Threads , Medium, Pinterest (with images )<br/>3 video focused channels: YouTube , Instagram , TikTok</p><p>1 “post” automatically sent to all different channels. Daily… for the next 30 days and I bet I’ll see results. We will revisit this and see how good I can do with that!</p><p>For you … think of a way to get going on marketing. But remember don’t go crazy. What do I mean? pick 1-2 channels to heavily focus on while the others are just repurposing the content with AI prompts to format them for those channels. So you write thread for X. Take that and turn it into a short video with AI, slideshow, etc for video and convert the thread into the correct formats for other channels.</p><p>All that matters is you start doing it.. do it for 30 days and I promise you you’ll see results.</p>"

    "title": "30 Days In: What I've Learned (Doubt, Money, and Dreams)",
    "content": "<p>30 days of writing this newsletter every single day. That's kinda crazy because I haven't focused on something this long and stayed with it in a long time. Prolly since the days I was playing basketball.</p><p>Here's what I learned:</p><ul><li>Major Doubt</li><li>Wanna Quit</li><li>Look at the subscriber count</li><li>Marketing</li></ul><p>So let's just start it right off with... I beat myself up on anything. I know things take time, but man, I am not good at it.</p><p>I have been product/ idea hopping since I was born, I feel like. The only thing that ever mattered to me was basketball. So it's nice to get into a groove, and writing every single day is surely awesome. But I didn't believe in myself this entire time. I even changed the type of newsletter this would be a few times. I went from it being about soloprenurship, to personal, to side hustles. So I switched, but I kept writing every day. Now I have a simple way to explain it. \" A Daily newsletter that makes you think\"</p><p>Why this? Well, I wanna write about whatever I want but also make it push you. You are the reason I get to write every day... So I wanna make it benefit you.</p><p>I've wanted to quit a few times on this and start something else because let's face it. During these 30 days... No money has come in from this newsletter. Which isn't a problem. But when you come from running micro saas's that get sales within their first 24 hours, not having anything for 30 days is a lot.</p><p>But the bright side is I haven't really \"sold\" anything. I am working on a short boo,k I guess, but not sure what I wanna do with it.</p><p>I have most likely looked at the subscriber count more than anything I've ever done. In the grocery store.. refresh list. Going to bed, refresh the list. waiting to pick up the kids from school, refresh the list. The number of times I've done it is kinda obsessive.</p><p>Marketing hasn't been good because I've switched so much in my marketing efforts. One thing I have done is write pretty much every day for Medium. You can follow my Medium account</p><p>Now that I talk about \"everything,\" I can make my marketing different and better? Not really sure, but the idea is to make it work. I will keep on talking and you can help me by keep on sending my issues to people.</p><p>Remember <strong>Never give up on your dreams.</strong> I have $-49 in my bank account while writiting this waiting for my new job to start. But I'm gonna stick with writing because I love it even if I never make a dollar from it.</p><p>Do something you love and you'll never feel like you worked a day in your life. That saying is true but they forget one thing you eventually need to make money. But most things people wanna do that they can DO they will make money if you stay consientent.</p><p>What do I mean by this?</p><p>I wanted to be a professional basketball player. Play for the NY knicks. That was my dream. But reality was I wasn't good enough. Yeah I played in college, but the Pros is a different league. It's another animal that I wasn't good enough for. So that was my dream. But my other dream has always been to write. What? I don't know a book maybe but as I said before, I love just writing and seeing what comes out. This is all top of my mind no edits, no reviews. That's how I write....</p><p>So this is a dream that can't happen right. You can do what you love but I can't go play basketball. Maybe over in europe but I'm to old. The point is if it's attainable like you wanna build a SaaS then sure you can do it. Nothing is holding you back now.</p><p>That's the cool thing about life right now. We are in the Dot com bubble (I was to young) where millionaires were made overnight. <strong>Don't miss this opportunity.</strong></p><p>Do 1 boring thing every single day and you'd be suprised what you can do. Writing not your thing? Make templates, sell them on Etsy. The possibilities are endless. Don't waste your time.</p><p>Build that thing that you love to do, and like me, after 30 days, see what happened. You'd be surprised. I may not of made any money, but I got almost 100 subscribers who read every issue + some of you have been so kind in your responses. I reply to all, so feel free to reach out on anything or tell me something cool you are working on!</p><p>30 days , 30 newsletter issues. Thank you for reading. I'm not stoping so here is to another 3000!</p>"

I earned over 50k from his boilerplate alone. **start building.** You'd be suprised what happens in 6 months.</p><p>P.S. - I'm on day 20 of writing this daily newsletter. The goal is to grow this to a million dollar business by sharing what works and ways to make money on the internet each day. But I don't have 1 set audience which I know is never good. So I'm asking you. What would you like to see me write about? If I find it interesting I'll write about it one day!</p>"

    "content": "<p>To write a good blog post takes time. AI can help you in the research department but you really need to put your own spin on stuff to get anything that will attract users, rank on google and do well for your blog, post or whatever you are working on.</p><p>How do I know this? I was a blogger back in the day...nothing special I did it in crazy simple niches that no one knew about but it's where I made my first internet money.</p><p>The blog was simple.... it was right when twitch and other sites were taking off and this concept of \"streaming\" video games was a thing.</p><p>The blog? Help you become a better stream... my best article was Best Streaming PC's and I'd link to top Products on amazon. I was getting 4% and killing it with 100's of users coming to my site daily. With some of these products selling for $1,000+ I was making decent money.</p><p>Then it all came down.. I stopped caring about the blog (typical me) and start focusing on another blog, the content got old and big players like forbes, toms hardware and others starting seeing the trend. They built out fully detailed articles with actual reviews (they bought the products as well). That was my first taste of ranking on google. <strong>I was hooked.</strong></p><p>Now while writing is easier because the ideas come faster, the highlights / overviews are easier to get. You still need to story tell and keep the reader in but also allow them to skim if they want. I don't have stats on it but my guess is 90% read the article till they see a highlight or \"top\" items. That's why lists up top or table of contents have become so popular.</p><p>Now every AI wrapper is trying to help you write blog posts. The artform is dying to just AI generate slop.</p><p>I still think if you do 90% AI and even as little as 10% human. You will rank on top of google.</p><p>So what should you do? **Start blogging.** If you don't wanna own it medium is a good platform and I've commited to writing daily on there and share results.</p>"

There is no better feeling than a paper and pen in bed writing about this newsletter issues.</p><p>Just like everything in life you have to do it for more than a few days. We are at 15 day of writing this and we have already amazed 60+ amazing subcribers. The funny part is I still don't have a \"niche\" I am just talking to you on whatever topics I want and you still join and read. Still waiting for you to reply so we can have a nice chat... but I won't hold you to replying.... just yet. **So write more**</p><p>It's how you get better. Michael Jordan worked out before and after games becaue he wanted to get better. The same thing applies to writing. We should all be writing daily. It only makes sense. It helps you in so many ways:</p><ul><li>Mental Health</li><li>Memory</li><li>Happyness</li></ul><p>Plus if you keep at it with where AI is going it's going to be more important than ever to have a \"voice\" and letting people understand you wrote something insead of AI. That's the million dollar product and if you can figure it out you are set. You wonder why I keep saying 1 million for this newsletter.... The only reason is I want it as the goal to say I can take a day off if I want. So for me to hit 1 million isn't gonna happen anytime soon.

Everyone can have their own way of getting more views because views convert to users. If you are a b2c people are on Tiktok, Intagram, Youtube etc.</p><p>The main thing is you need to understand where your audience is. If you are posting on Linked In you may not get the same engagment as you would on Tiktok. One of my favorite newsletter is TLDR. He is always looking for sponsorships and charges a hefty penny for them and he runs those ads on Linked In.... because that's where his audience is for that specific item. When he was looking for subscribers, he mentioned in a podcast that he used quora to get his initial subscribers.</p><p>for me my plan is simple. GO viral on X and other writing platofrms and keep on building out this newsletter to help you become a better writer. Because as I've mentioned AI is taking over and <strong>storytelling will become an even bigger skill</strong> that I am betting all my eggs on. None of my content is AI generated this is straight from my mind to these emails. I don't prep, I just write and then hope it makes sense. So how can you go viral?</p><p>Focus on one platform. If you are doing like me am doing... writing. X is a good start and with tools like typefully (affiliate link) you can cross-promote seamly so you are getting users on other social medias. We are only on day 14 and I have seen improvements in my writing and how to get things down and explain them. I have a long way to go without having run on sentences etc... but it's progress for me. So we will continue on this route. In the next few weeks I'll be posting detailed threads to socials to see if that can drive traffic.</p><p>New here? make sure to subscribe</p>"

Your followers will grow slowly as long as the initial ones you start with are active. Do you know who's always in your comment section etc? I do. These are the people you ping or write to on the side to get feedback. Your first users, your base community... **They are the core of your business. Treat them like royalty.**</p><p>There is a reason you don't hear of many cases where someone blows up in a month.... most people grind for months, years before they get their big break.</p><p>The good thing is with small audiences is you are able to keep those people close to you and just like this newsletter you feel closer with them. I'm only writing to 53 of you right now. One day I may be writing to 50,000 but I'll never forget you.</p><p>Keep going and making an effort to become the best you can be.

If you can build an audience then sell something to them you have a good chance of making good money. Become the expert.</li><li>**Affiliate Links** - If you are like me you have always built blogs around affiliate links. Back in the day I even was building web hosting blogs to promote high paying web host companies. This is no different now but no longer do you need to write it in a blog or post. You can simply post to Youtube/Tiktok and add your affilaite link.</li><li>**Sponsorships** - Build an audience like I metnioned before and then sell spots in where your audience is. This one is tricky because unless you have an email like I am doing, adding content on your social media to much with ads is a lot.</li></ul><p>There are plenty more ways to do this but imo these are the best ways to grow now. With AI taking over you need to build something that people want, grow an audience in a niche you love or else you will fall behind. I was able to build 10+ apps make 50K from them and sell them all off. All from AI and this course. Kinda crazy that you can build profitable side hustles in days.</p><p>What was the best way to make money you have seen? Do you agree with the 3 areas I've picked. Would love your feedback.</p>"

Everyone can give the details of their products, their newsletter, the thing they are building.</p><p>But.... **can you make some pay.**</p><p>That's the hard part but you can make it easier if you do a few things:</p><ul><li>**Market to the right audience.** A fisherman looking for new lures won't be interested in a new running shoe. Find where your audience hangs out and live there.</li><li>**Make the product sell itself.** Don't overcomplicate anything. Your thesis should make it dead simple for people to get why they should buy. 99% of the time people buy on impulse.</li><li>**Give yourself 3-6 months.** As someone who product jumped a lot and looking back on it now that I'm writing this newsletter everyday. I wish I focused on things for longer. Built a legit product then worried about expanding it.</li><li>**Talk to your customers.** If you have 1 person or 100 make sure you ask them for feedback. Just like this newsletter. I'd love you to reply to this email (I answer all emails) and tell me what you like, what you don't like. Where you think I should go etc.</li><li>**Don't get hurt if they say no.** Rejection happens you can google all those stats that say 1 in 100 or 3% of people don't buy on the first time etc. You have to sell someone 7 times before they will buy. They will buy it or subscribe if you do it right and are in their circle.</li></ul><p>So what should you be doing. You should be posting more on socials... adding more pSEO content to your site. Use free tools to build your brand aweareness. That's what I did with niche tools.</p><p>P.S. - Have you shared this newsletter with anyone?

Not because I was an artist or someone with a talent but more becaue I knew the sayings people would love.</p><p>One of my most popular ones? Dunkie Junkie.... A play on the popular coffee chain Dunkin.</p><p>The thing was. I had 1,000's of designs and It didn't really take off for about a year but then it went crazy. I even posted about it on reddit and it became one of my highest posts.</p><p>but with everything I do... I stopped focusing on it because I wasn't enjoying it I wasn't getting the sales, subscribers I wanted (1-2 sales a day) so I moved on.</p><p>Then Christmas came and my earnings went insane. 2k , 4k , 10k (December) and I started posting new designs, but I think it was to late. My products did well but then 100's of copycats came in lowered their prices and my margins were at $0.</p><p>I moved on and the 2-3k a month I was making slowly went down till this past year where we hit $10-$15 a month.</p><p>Ok Matt so what is the point? **The point is... don't give up, don't ever give up.** Just because your idea doesn't \"hit\" you can always find another one or similar one.

Second off... ya caught me. I may not know exactly how to do it yet. But little known fact is I already built 3 newsletter and sold them before this one. But I ain't selling this one ever. You are to special to sell to the top dollar even if they offer me $10 for you. I ain't ever selling. So I'm not a noob to the newsletter game and my previous newsletter I grew all from reddit.

People are more willing to subscribe/take a chance on your stuff if they know you are being honest. **Be honest, let them see what your going through. You will get more conversions and true fans that way.**</p><p>Finally the biggest one of all. Even though I have 42 subscribers. I haven't gone down since I started.... Why? I am not selling anything. In reality I'm doing the opposite... I'm learning and sharing what I learn for free. If someone reads all of my issues till I make my 1 million dollar mark. I feel like they will be able to do anything. Learning is half the battle and I love to learn new things to get ahead of the crowd. Now you get access to that as well. But don't tell anyone... we can keep that between us.

Of course there are... but no one is doing a **\"personal brand\"** and trying to grow to 1 million subscribers in public.</p><p>So this is my plan. Build in Public but for new subscribers. My biggest problem right now isn't how to do it. It's what to focus on. Because let's be real. To Keep users interested most of the time you have to have something you always talk about or help them with. The obvious choice is being that newsletter person everyone talks about but sometimes that only get's so far. I need to think like James Clear. His newsletter is read by millions and it's a simple email. IT makes you think. Plus he has been doing it for a long time. So it makes sense.</p><p>See here is the thing... AI is gonna take over so much... that really all you have left is **being yourself.** So.... I'm building up my personal brand to make you fall in love with my writing. Sure I'll advertise here and there but most of the time we will just be talking.</p><p>That's step 1 of my master plan. Writing every single day \"should\" get me more people to read my stuff... one would hope. Then I take these newsletter issues and turn them into \"learning\" medium articles + reformat them for blog posts. This should help me with SEO and market shares I'm not 100% focused on but can bring in some good traffic in a year or two. Then the big one and my main focus for now - High quality threads or posts on Linked In, X, Threads. My only problem right now with them is... I don't know what to focus on... So I am testing the markets with different posts like this one or even this one. We can see what people love. so we keep building our audience. My theory is as I grow my following my subscribers will grow in this newsletter... but if you have ever done email marketing... you know the hardest part is getting someone to sign up to your email.</p><p>so let's keep moving.

It's simple.</p><p>If you have someone email, two things happen.</p><ul><li>They are a true fan because people don't give up their emails.</li><li>If you lose all your stuff/sell it get banned etc. You still have the peoples emails.</li></ul><p>It's important to go all in on email marketing. Plus I have had my best results from email campaigns. My old product Niche Tools did over 5k in sales just from my newsletter alone.</p><p>Learn to story tell + sell and your 1 million dollar business will come faster than you think.... at least that's my hope. My plan to grow this newsletter to 1 million subscribers + 1 million dollars in revenue is kinda crazy but I love crazy and for the first time in 2 + years I am happy to do something. People are liking this writing so much they even asked me to ghost write for them... So I guess my calling after all was email?</p><p>Happy Monday. Let's make this a great week.</p>"

    "title": "Finding Customers: The Solopreneur's Cheat Code",
    "content": "<p>Find your customers At the end of the day everything is a sell. You are selling something. It can range from liking an Instagram photo of your family to selling a digital product to your email list. You are always doing something that involves a sale.</p><p>The hardest part isn't the sale.... It's finding the right customers. Yesterday, Justin Welsh published his weekly newsletter, which is a big inspiration to me. He has figured out this solo business model and he really understands how to market. You can read his entire issue here: Leverage is the solopreneur cheat code</p><p>In a nutshell he broke down exactly how you need to build an audience and I'm gonna steal some of his tactics to grow my followings over the next few months. He said this:</p><blockquote>\"But now I follow the 5-12-3 rule, which makes my life a heck of a lot easier. Every piece of content must work in 5 seconds (the hook grabs attention), remain relevant 12 months later (try your best for evergreen value), and function across at least three platforms (repurposing).\"</blockquote><p>So it got me thinking. I need to focus on this in my space and start producing high quality content I can share across all socials. **SO it's time to lock in** and grow my customer base (subscribers) to a level that most haven't seen. I have 3 new subscribers from yestreday and my content is starting to be seen by a bigger audience. I plan to keep growing this newsletter and as mentioned before this is my only focus.</p><p>Have a good Sunday & talk tomorrow.</p>"

    "content": "<p>It's been a crazy 2 years since I joined the X community of indie hackers. I've built lots of stuff and had plenty of failures. But I've had quiet a few successes. Niche Tools, Build The Idea, Under2k, to name a few. All of which did well for me.</p><p>The best one ? Niche Tools. Did over 50k in total sales. I also sold it and bought it back (a story for another day).</p><p>Why am I saying all this? Simple. This newsletter's goal is to generate 50k in revenue in one year. We are only on day 2. So we got a long way to go. I also don't want to sell sponsorships and want to keep this personal. We will see how I sprinkle in some of these ideas. I wanna work on my storytelling. It's an art form that I'd love to master. Keeping you reading to the very last line. I know how quickly I move on the next thing.</p><p>So what is the goal of this newsletter? It's simple. **Improve everyday & build it into a 1 million dollar business.** How? Not sure but I'm ready to try. so we keep writing and we will see what it brings me.</p><p>Until tomorrow!</p>"

    "content": "<p>I promise this is the last time I'm swapping topics! Look if you have followed me you know I go from one thing to another. The crazy thing is I always wanted to stick to one thing and one thing only for a year.</p><p>I've had plenty of people tell me I need to and show people about different ways I talk and write and just really be myself. Talk about what I want on X, post what I want on here and just not worry about the money and fame.</p><p>So here's the deal. Today is Isssue #1. I am going to write for the next 365 days about anything I want. I'll focus on what I'm interested on like finance news, crypto, ideas, side hustles etc but sometimes I may talk about how my kids were horrible and what I looked up as a dad. The point is, I'm just gonna write everyday and see what happens. I'll also post it to medium and see the type of following I grow just talking about my thoughts.</p><p>I hope you follow me on the journey. See you tomorrow with topic #1 Share this with a friend because this is gonna get juicy. Oh I'm gonna be transparent also. So today we have 32 subscribers. Let's document it all.</p>"
